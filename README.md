# PheonixGPMoto

An iPhone-driven motorcycle navigation display built on the E87 electronic
display badge. The native Swift proof of concept and BLE refresh benchmark live
in [`ios/`](./ios/).

This project started from the open-source AuraCast E87/L8 protocol implementation;
the original documentation is preserved below for protocol and hardware reference.

### The open-source web app for round LED smart badges

**Upload custom images, GIFs, animations, scrolling text, patterns, and QR codes — straight from your browser. No app store. No USB cable. No account.**

> ### Just bought a round LED badge?
>
> The round LED smart badges sold on **Amazon**, **AliExpress**, **Temu**, and **TikTok Shop** as:
>
> **E87** · **L8** · **X9** · **LED Smart Badge** · **Anime Smart Badge** · **Anime LED Pin** · **Aura Badge** · **DIY Light Up Pin** · **Wearable Display Pin** · **Round LED Name Tag** · **Smart LED Bluetooth Pin** · **Akinokai Display Pin** · **384x384 Round Pin** · **Programmable LED Badge** · **Custom Image Pin** · **Anime LED Lapel Pin** · **HiBadge** · **Bluetooth LED Pin** · **Round OLED Badge**
>
> ...all use the same Jieli BLE chip and speak the same protocol. If you have one of these, **AuraCast works with it.**
>
> The stock **Zrun** app (also shipped as "LED Badge", "HiBadge", "Badgy") is buggy, ad-filled, and barely works on iOS. AuraCast is the open-source replacement.

## Quick Start

1. **Press the side button** on your badge to wake it up
2. **Open AuraCast** in Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, or Opera — [launch it here](https://manaiakalani.github.io/auracast/)
3. **Click Connect** and pick your badge (`E87` or `L8...`) from the Bluetooth picker
4. **Drag in an image**, pick a pattern, type some text, or import a GIF — then click **Send**

That's it. The image appears on your badge in seconds.

> **iPhone / Safari / Firefox?** Web Bluetooth isn't available in those browsers. A Python relay is planned but not yet included. For now, use a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera) on a supported platform. See [Browser Support](#browser-support).

## Features

| | Feature | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ✨ | **29 animated patterns** | Matrix Rain, Aurora Ribbons, Fireworks, Clock Face, Flow Field, Reaction Diffusion, Voronoi Crystals, Kaleidoscope, Danmaku, and more. All procedurally generated as seamless loops. |
| 🖼️ | **Image upload** | Drag-and-drop JPEG, PNG, WebP, or HEIC. Auto-cropped and fitted to the badge's circular 368x368 OLED display. |
| 🎞️ | **GIF import** | Drop an animated GIF — frames are decoded, circular-cropped, and packed as a looping MJPEG animation on the badge. |
| 🔤 | **Text effects** | Scrolling marquee, static text, rainbow, glitch, and danmaku modes. Custom colors, fonts, sizes. |
| 🎬 | **Video clips** | Trim MP4/MOV clips to fit the badge's 900 KB storage. Frame-by-frame preview before sending. |
| 📱 | **QR codes** | High-contrast circular QR codes that scan right off the badge. |
| 🖼️ | **Image sequences** | Multi-frame slideshows that loop on-device. |
| 🔋 | **Battery + charging** | Live battery percentage with charging state indicator. |
| 🔆 | **Brightness control** | Adjust badge screen brightness via slider. |
| 🩺 | **Diagnostics** | One-click connection probe for troubleshooting. |
| 🌗 | **Material 3 design** | Dark/light theme with M3 Expressive design tokens. |
| 📲 | **PWA install** | Install as a home-screen app on any device. |
| 🔒 | **Fully private** | Zero analytics. Zero cookies. Zero tracking. Zero network requests beyond your own badge. |

## Is My Badge Supported?

If your badge is:
- **Round** (35-45 mm diameter)
- Connects via **Bluetooth Low Energy** (advertises as `E87`, `L8`, `X9`, or `LED Badge`)
- Came with the **Zrun** / **HiBadge** / **LED Badge** app
- Has a **full-color OLED/LCD display** (not a monochrome scrolling text badge)

...it almost certainly works. All these listings use the same **Jieli BR23** chipset.

> **Not supported:** Square scrolling-text badges (64x16, 32x8 pixel) use a different protocol entirely. See [badgemagic](https://github.com/jnesselr/badge_magic) for those.

## Browser Support

| Browser | Platform | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome / Edge / Brave / Arc / Opera | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS | Direct Web Bluetooth |
| Safari | macOS, iOS, iPadOS | Via Python relay (Wi-Fi) |
| Firefox | All | Via Python relay (Wi-Fi) |
| Chrome on iOS | iOS | Via Python relay (iOS Chrome = WebKit) |

### Python relay (for Safari / Firefox / iPhone)

> **Note:** The Python relay is planned but not yet included in this repository.
> For now, only browsers with native Web Bluetooth support (Chrome, Edge, Brave,
> Arc, Opera on desktop and Android) can communicate directly with the badge.
> Safari, Firefox, and iOS Chrome users should use a Chromium-based browser on a
> supported platform.

## Why Not Just Use the Zrun App?

| Zrun pain point | AuraCast |
|---|---|
| iOS Bluetooth permissions fail silently | Standard Web Bluetooth or Wi-Fi relay |
| Crashes on uploads over ~200 KB | Streaming uploader with retries, tested to 900 KB |
| Fills flash storage, refuses new uploads | Single-slot overwrite — always room for next upload |
| Locked to whichever app the seller bundled | One app for every rebrand of the same chipset |
| Ads, account signup, telemetry | Zero ads, zero tracking, zero accounts, fully local |
| Closed source | MIT-licensed, fully auditable, PRs welcome |

## Protocol Documentation

The complete BLE protocol reverse-engineering — every byte of the FE/DC/BA framing, Jieli RCSP authentication handshake, file metadata, windowed data transfer, CRC, and capture format — lives in **[PROTOCOL.md](./PROTOCOL.md)**.
